# A description of everyone's research activity

* Individual descriptions:

* Joseph Allingham: 
Joseph is a PhD student. He is working on Buffalo data to constrain dark matter through strong gravitational lensing through the software Lenstool. He also probes theories of modified gravity. He additionally is interested in questioning the usual lensing approximations.

* Lawrence Hou Dam:


* Sonia Akter Ema:
Sonia is a PhD student. She is working on weak gravitational lensing implementing the predictions of general relativity.
By using N-body simulations as well as by developing a ray-tracing code she is now studying how the light rays from far away galaxies propagate through the universe and how its properties (e.g. energy, redshift, scale factor, size, shape) changes. 


* Rasel Hossen:
Rasel is a PhD student, working on the effects of weak gravitational lensing in cosmology.
He is particularly interested to study the weak lensing statistical quantities: shear, magnification, and their corresponding angular power spectra to understand the evolution of the large-scale structure in the curved spacetime of general relativity.


* Florian List:
Florian List is a PhD student focusing on computational astrophysics. His research involves running and analysing hydrodynamic simulations with dark matter particles that interact non-gravitationally, e.g. by pair annihilating into standard model particles. Such exotic physics might be discovered or further constrained within the coming years using state of the art telescopes such as the JWST and the SKA. Moreover, he is investigating how machine learning methods can be used for generating astrophysical mock data and for parameter inference.


* Angela Ng:
My research interests include all aspects of cosmology, gravitational and fundamental physics. The current focus of my research is using time delays from strong gravitational lensing to probe cosmology. More details about me can be found at my personal website. [ LINK alhn.carrd.co ]


* Mathew Varidel:
My focus is on the evolution and drivers of turbulent motions within the interstellar medium of galaxies. During my PhD I have developed a forward-modelling technique that allows for estimates of the intrinsic gas kinematics within galaxies that mitigates known observational effects. This approach is being applied to large galaxy samples in order to shed light on the drivers of gas turbulence across epochs.


* Zhen Wan:
My focus is on Galactic Archeology with broad topics including the MW galactic halo properties, halo substructures including GC, stellar stream, LMC, and structures in M31. 


* Troy Whinray:
My research focuses on improving the Schwarzschild Method which is an orbit based technique used to build models of galaxies. This method is an orbit based method and proceeds by constructing a galaxies's kinematic data by integrating tens to hundreds of thousands of mock stars to construct a data set.
To improve this method I am writing  a supercomputing version of Schwarzschild Method with flavours of Bayesian Statistics. The motivation to do this arises from the fact that the Schwarzschild Method is a computationally demanding technique and it's application and reach can be constrained due to this fact.
A supercomputer version would be able to tackle a wider range of tasks. To do this involves writing a concurrent code for the Schwarzschild in the computationally fast language, C++ and paralleized it with MPI to take advantage of clustered computing systems. The end goal of this code to provide a
Bayesian plausiablity for different dark matter models and the Bayesian evidence of the presence and size of central Black Holes in galaxies and globular clusters.
