# A description of everyone's research activity

* Individual descriptions:

* Joseph Allingham: 
Joseph is a PhD student. He is working on Buffalo data to constrain dark matter through strong gravitational lensing. He also tries to modify gravity, and is interested in questioning the usual lensing approximations.

* Florian List:
Florian List is a PhD student focusing on computational astrophysics. His research involves running and analysing hydrodynamic simulations with dark matter particles that interact non-gravitationally, e.g. by pair annihilating into standard model particles. Such exotic physics might be discovered or further constrained within the coming years using state of the art telescopes such as the JWST and the SKA. Moreover, he is investigating how machine learning methods can be used for generating astrophysical mock data and for parameter inference.
