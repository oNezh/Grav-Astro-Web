	   Richard's research focuses on the kinematics of star clusters, using the dynamics of these clusters to infer the quantity of dark matter they contain, and for answering the question "do we understand how gravity truly behaves". He also studies the evolution of the Milky Way through observation of dwarf satellite galaxies. Interactions between a satellite and its host produce tidal debris. Analysing this debris can uncover the origins of the material in different parts of such a system and will eventually reveal a unified galactic evolutionary model.

	   Madhura studies theoretical gravitational lensing in various regimes. She is creating a ray-tracing code that is applied to N-body simulations of cosmological mass distributions; the results are used to understand cosmic shear and predict supernovae magnification biases. She is also making self-consistent comparisons of the galaxy cluster subhalo mass function between simulations and lensing data. Her research extends to analysing the lensing effect on the cosmological redshift drift experiment. --><!--	   <br><br><a href="http://fmx01whs.ucc.usyd.edu.au:8080/physics/staff_details.jsp?ID=782.0">+ <!--Contact Details</a><br><a href="http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~madhura">+ Home Page</a></td>

spectacular jets as well as X-ray and gamma-ray emission in the nuclei

Juliana is a PhD student in theoretical cosmology. Her main area of
interest is large scale structure, in particular how its rate of growth
can be measured from amplifications in the power spectrum induced by
the peculiar motion of galaxies. A measurement of the growth rate of
structure formation would allow us to distinguish between a number of
proposed modifications to general relativity with the aim of
understanding the origin of cosmic acceleration. Juliana has also
investigated the ability of an inhomogenous cosmological model, such as
the Timescape Cosmology, to fit the currently available observational
data. She has found that the Timescape Cosmology is generally a much
poorer fit to the Hubble diagram when compared to the standard
cosmological model. <br>

Hugh works in computational gravitational microlensing; he has
implemented a supercomputer version of a microlensing simulation tool
so that it uses parallelism, distributed memory and file caching. Using
this he is investigating various real lensed quasars to test models of
quasar structure, lens galaxy structure, and the properties of dark
matter. This is achieved by running simulations, getting data, and
testing them against observations, or making predictions as to future
observations. The work is being published as results become available,
the new supercomputer simulation program has already been described in
an article in New Astronomy journal. <br>
